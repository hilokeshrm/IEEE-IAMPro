# 📊 Personalized Presentation Plan

## **1. Slide Flow (10–12 slides for 10–12 mins)**

Each slide will correspond to a clear talking point from your reports:

1. **Title & Introduction**

   * Your name, team, mentor, title: *Digital Phenotyping for Early Detection of Student Stress*.
   * Quick hook: “75% of students report stress; 1 in 5 face severe impact. Our project aims to detect it early.”

2. **Problem Definition**

   * Why stress detection matters (impact on students’ performance & health).
   * Traditional methods vs. digital phenotyping.

3. **Literature Review**

   * Mention **StudentLife**, **mindLAMP**, **Vibe Up** systems.
   * Highlight gaps → no hybrid sensing + weak real-time feedback.

4. **Proposed System**

   * Show architecture diagram (Flutter app + Firebase backend).
   * Explain hybrid approach: passive + active sensing.

5. **System Architecture & Tech Stack**

   * Mobile app: Flutter + sensors.
   * Backend: Firebase (Firestore, Functions).
   * ML: Python, SVM model.
   * Wearables: Fitbit, HealthKit.

6. **Implementation Journey** (Phase-wise)

   * April: UI, Firebase setup, sensor integration.
   * May: Pilot launch, wearable integration, GDPR/HIPAA compliance.
   * June: Stable release v1.0, model validation, statistical analysis.

7. **Key Features Built**

   * Passive sensing (mobility, location, sleep).
   * Active surveys & chatbot check-ins.
   * Gamification (streaks, badges).
   * Admin dashboard (heatmaps, data export).

8. **Results & Insights**

   * Pilot users: 88–90% retention, >70% survey adherence.
   * Data completeness >90% (internal sensors).
   * Stress prediction accuracy: correlation 0.63 with surveys.
   * Insight: stress spikes linked to late-night phone use + inactivity.

9. **Knowledge & Skills Gained**

   * Tools: Flutter, Firebase, OAuth, wearable APIs.
   * Concepts: Ecological Momentary Assessment, ML model training, privacy laws (GDPR, HIPAA).
   * Soft skills: teamwork, debugging, user engagement.

10. **Conclusion & Future Work**

    * Conclusion: Hybrid sensing works for stress detection.
    * Future: anomaly detection, counselor alerts, publication of research paper.

11. **Acknowledgement & Certification Proof**

    * Show certificate screenshot (as per GITAM guidelines).

12. **Q\&A**

    * End confidently: “Thank you. I’d be happy to answer your questions.”

## **2. Practice Strategy (to match Rubrics)**

* **Presentation Skills (20M):**

  * Rehearse transitions between slides.
  * Vary voice pitch when presenting results vs. problem.
  * Maintain eye contact → glance at slides only as reference.

* **Timing & Pace (5M):**

  * Each slide ≈ 1 min → total 10–12 min.
  * Practice with stopwatch twice.

* **Audibility & Clarity (5M):**

  * Speak clearly, moderate speed.
  * Avoid jargon → explain terms briefly (“Digital phenotyping means using phone sensors to capture behavior”).

* **Technical Content & Viva (10M):**

  * Be ready for questions:

    1. “Why did you choose Flutter + Firebase?”
    2. “How accurate is your model?”
    3. “How is privacy ensured?”
  * Keep crisp 30–40 sec answers.

* **Certification (30M) & Report (30M):**

  * Double-check formatting, dates, domain relevance.
  * Keep both reports + certificate handy in soft & printed form.

Perfect 👍 Let’s build you a **phase-wise action plan** so you can **maximize marks in every rubric**. I’ll align each phase with your rubric table so nothing is left out.

# 📅 Phase-Wise Plan to Nail the Presentation

## **Phase 1 – Preparation (Before Presentation Day)**

🔹 **Technical Content & Viva (10M)**

* Write down *3–4 key technical learnings* from your internship.
* For each, prepare:

  * **Definition / Concept** (short + crisp)
  * **Example from your internship** (what you did, how you applied it)
  * **One line about impact** (why it mattered).
* Prepare **probable viva questions**:

  * “What was your role in the project?”
  * “What challenges did you face, and how did you solve them?”
  * “Explain one technical tool/algorithm/method you used.”

🔹 **Internship Report & Certification (30M + 30M)**

* Double-check that **your report & certificate** are perfectly formatted as per GITAM guidelines.
* Check submission deadlines. Do not delay.

---

## **Phase 2 – Slide & Script Design**

🔹 **Presentation Skills (20M)**

* Use **10–12 slides** (1 min per slide ≈ 10–12 min).
  Suggested Flow:

  1. Title & Your Details
  2. Internship Organization Intro
  3. Objective of Internship
  4. Your Role & Tasks
  5. Key Technical Learning #1
  6. Key Technical Learning #2
  7. Key Technical Learning #3
  8. Challenges & Solutions
  9. Outcomes (What you achieved + certificate proof screenshot)
  10. Conclusion & Acknowledgement

* Design Rules:

  * Minimal text → use **bullet points + visuals**.
  * Highlight technical terms (bold/colored).
  * Insert **one diagram/flowchart** to explain your work.

---

## **Phase 3 – Practice Delivery**

🔹 **Timing & Pace (5M)**

* Rehearse **2–3 times with timer** → aim for 10–12 min.
* Keep pace steady:

  * Start slow, introduce confidently.
  * Speed up slightly during easy slides.
  * Slow down again when explaining technical parts.

🔹 **Presentation Skills (20M)**

* **Voice:** vary pitch, avoid monotone.
* **Body language:** stand straight, hands free (no pocket/fidgeting).
* **Eye contact:** glance across the room (don’t stare at slides).
* **Connector phrases:** use transitions like

  * “Now let’s move to the technical part…”
  * “To overcome this challenge, I did…”

🔹 **Audibility & Comprehensibility (5M)**

* Practice speaking louder than normal in a room.
* Use a **clear tone** (avoid filler words like “umm, like, you know”).
* Break complex points into 2 short sentences.

---

## **Phase 4 – On Presentation Day**

✅ Arrive early, check projector + slides.
✅ Open with confidence: *“Good morning, respected faculty and friends. Today I will be presenting my internship experience at \_\_\_.”*
✅ Smile, take a pause before starting → sets confidence.
✅ Don’t read slides → glance and then explain in your own words.
✅ End with: *“Thank you. I’ll be happy to answer your questions.”* → shows confidence for viva.

---

## **Phase 5 – During Viva**

* Listen carefully, don’t rush.
* If you don’t know, say: *“That’s an interesting question, I haven’t worked much on it but my understanding is…”* → still shows effort.
* Keep answers short (30–40 seconds max).

---

# ✅ Summary Cheat-Sheet to Max Marks

* **Slides (10–12) → Clean + Logical flow.**
* **Timing (10–12 min) → Practice with stopwatch.**
* **Voice (clear, varied pitch, loud enough).**
* **Eye contact & body language → confident, no fidgeting.**
* **Technical prep → 3–4 key learnings + viva Q\&A.**
* **Report & Certificate → submitted correctly.**
